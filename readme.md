software simulated processor for learning written in C

## build
	cd ./Sim/build
	gcc ./main.c
## usage
	USER INPUT:
- 1 load .mem file
- 3 show content of all registers
- 7 assemble (same directory full name)
- 8 execute program

## Introduction/WHY?

- learned from old project
- new try at making a microprocessor/computer (let's see what happens)
- deepen my understanding of Computers/Processors and Software

### Requirements/What do I  need to solve?
- [x] decoding of instructions
- [x] 1 memory channel -> single memory for DAT,INS,etc...
- [ ] memory management
- [x] useful amount of registers

#### 	-> clean processing concept

Problems:
control of big memory
organizing in memory DAT,INS
 function of jumps
	
## SCRAPPED
I wanted to build the CPU with chips of the CD40XX and 74XX series. Due to high cost and not much time, this idea is scrapped.
